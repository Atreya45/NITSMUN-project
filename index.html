<h3>About Us</h3>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
        NITSMUN was founded in 2014 when a group of like-minded people wanted to create a society for younger people to discuss,
        debate, and deliberate present-day crises whilst experiencing themselves being in the shoes of various world leaders.
        Ever since the first MUN session in 2014, our society has grown manifold with more enthusiastic people joining in and
        helping us emerge as one the best and most promising MUN societies in NE India. Our conference offers its delegates an
        unrivaled Model UN experience by running highly personalized, engaging, and dynamic committees.
        Besides having participated in various MUNs in and around the country and bringing home numerous accolades and valuable
        experience, we have also hosted MUNs every single year since, with multiple mock sessions and collaborative conferences
        with world-class universities, with awe-inspiring members of the EB training and guiding us to think rationally, act
        quickly and solve modern-day problems and at the same time also provide us with the support required. NITSMUN aims at
        polishing the interpersonal, debating, and deliberating skills of the participants and mold them into a leader of
        tomorrow.

    <h3>What is a Model UN?</h3>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    <section class="un" id="un">
        A Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations. Students act as delegates and discuss real-world
        problems. These simulations are conducted by various universities, colleges, and schools to elevate the debating,
        presentation, oratory, deliberative skills of students and acquaint them with the pressing ongoing problems in the world
        and give them an opportunity to brainstorm and try finding solutions to them, whilst keeping in mind their foreign
        policies. Every conference has different committees and each committee discourses upon a certain agenda and tries to
        find fixes and solutions to the problems.
